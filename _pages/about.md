**Paraíso Reavido** (en: *Paradise Regained*) is the name of a less known work by the english poet John Milton and regards of the salvation plan for humanity after the Fall, already described in his previous and far more recognized work, *Paradise Lost*.

I chose this name not only because I idolize Milton but also because although this weblog themes may look quite dark pessimistic, I'm a christian, then hope is my commandment for keeping the faith of the future comeback of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

## Hello there!

My name is **Miguel Ferreira** and I'm a *Data Scientist* and *web/desktop developer*.

Although you may think I'm a person more concerned to technological and programming subjects, I believe you may get surprised throughout the reading of this blog. Even though I am, so to speak, someone from STEM knowledge, it's not there I bound myself only. Even the reason why I started writing this blog is not exactly for sharing strictly technical tips and knowledge (despite I think the content available here may be indispensable for those who work on this area).

Do you know the guy above? He's Mircea Eliade. He is an inspiration to me ever since I was introducted to him. Philosophy, religion, and culture have been my primal interests. Eliade raptured me in the very moment I read his *Patterns on Comparative Religion*. He is the causative factor for a plenty of articles in this blog. 

Originally, I've always been enthusiast to abstract subjects. I read more philosophy in my teenage then I do
technical books today (and I read lot of them currently, you'll find a plenty of books here). 

Here are a few interesting features of this Jekyll theme:

- Custom collections for different types of material (note-taking, journal writing, etc.)
- An auto-generating archive page that displays all entries from _all_ collections.
- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.
- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)
- Full Rouge support for syntax highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)
